Arduino ADNS2610 library, by Leoneq ;3
April, 2020. Based on code by Conor Peterson (robotrobot@gmail.com): https://conorpeterson.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/optical-mouse-hacking-part-1/
To test this library, you need to program your arduino with example sketch, and open the processing sketch.
Just remember to change some things. This library supports a single and RGB LED.
